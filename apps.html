    <h1>Final Project</h1>
          <table>
              <p> This is my Final Project that me and Alejandro have worked on this semester. I am genuinely proud of this project, mainly because coding isn't my strong suit. But by working together with someone I was able to showcase my strengths while being able to work on my weaknesses. We were able to work hand in hand to create this project. Essentially our final project is an educational app that asks the user to test their knowledge on topics ranging from Math to Physics to Chemisty and History. The user clicks on the topic that they would like to test and it brings them to a screen that shows them 4 questions. We have incorporated buttons in order to have them recieve instant feedback on whether the choice they picked is correct or incorrect. If the user wants to change topics all they need to do is hit restart on Khan and they will be able to choose a new topic and repeat the answering process. These questions are typed out and the buttons are coded using objects to make it easier for the user as they will know whether their choice was correct.  </p>
